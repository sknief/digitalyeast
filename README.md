## README.md

This repository is for the code used in my research semester 2020 (code name digital yeast) @ UQ. 

It is still a work in progress and this documentation did not start at the beginning of my project, therefore the history of master branch is not reflective of the total research effort. I will upload my old versions at some point. 

I am the sole author of this code, but I did lean on the SLiM manual (http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf) while working on this project.
