## README.md

This repository is for the code used in my research semester 2020 in the OB Lab @ UQ. It is written in Eidos to be used in SLiM3 (https://messerlab.org/slim/), but Github/Linguist does not recognize this language (yet! See my projects tab: https://github.com/sknief?tab=projects). Eidos is based on R, so this is the classification Linguist uses. 

It is still a work in progress and this documentation did not start at the beginning of my project, therefore the history of the master branch is not reflective of the total research effort. Pull requests and other branches may also have new code yet to be merged. 

I am the sole author of this code, but I did lean on the SLiM manual (http://benhaller.com/slim/SLiM_Manual.pdf) while working on this project.
