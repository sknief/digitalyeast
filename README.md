# Digital Yeast : A Digital Model Organism for SLiM 3

## What is "Digital Yeast"?

Digital Yeast (DY) is the first functional virtual model organism created for SLiM 3. It encompasses the the GAL Switch of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model network chosen. While only the GAL Switch is explicitly modelled in terms of focal genes and network structure, this system operates within the biological constraints of S. cerevisiae and reproduces sexually in a density-dependent matter as diploid yeast. 

Essentially, you can think of individual simulation runs of DY as monitoring a petridish of S. cerevisiae in the lab! 

## Functions and Features

## Getting Started

Digital Yeast is extremely easy to use for your own projects and studies. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
